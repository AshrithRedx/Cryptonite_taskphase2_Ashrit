This is a multi-level challenge which involves usage of http-headers to meet the requirements of the website.

### Steps:
1) Open the browser and send it to repeater in burpsuite.
2) Change the User-Agent Browser to PicoBrowser as it accepts only PicoBrowser as the sole browser.
3) Add a repeater header and add the same host address to cross verify that the User is using PicoBrowser.

4) Since the level prompts that the website could only be used in 2018, add a Date header and set the date to any time in the year 2018.
  Format: <day_name> <date> <month> <year> <hour>:<minute>:<second> GMT

5) Add a header named *DNT* which stands for "Do Not Track" which can accept three arguments: 0 to allow tracking, 1 to disable tacking and NULL for either.

6) Since the next level prompts the user to be from Sweden, we can set Sweden's IP Address with the HTTP Command
     *X-Forwaded-For* and add any IP address from Sweden.

7) At last, change the Accept-Language Header to Swedish Language, and obtain the flag.
