**This question uses XML payload which means it might be susceptible to XXE Injection.** 

### Method:
1) Open the website in burp where the user will be shown a webpage containing three courses. Click on *View Details* under picoCTF.
2) Send the request to the repeater. This is a classical case of XXE Injection.
3) Since we have to retreive information from the /etc/passwrd file, paste this command under <xml (version)>
'''
     <!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY test SYSTEM 'file:///etc/passwd'>]
'''
   This is command which retreives information from /etc/password while passing test as a parameter.

5) Change the information under <id> to &test to retreive the information and send the request to obtain the flag.
