In this challenge, we need to modify the cookies present in the website.

The website initally asks to login as a guest.
Once we Login, we are prompted with the message saying no guest previliges are available at the moment.

We can modify the cookies which can be accessed in the following way:
1) View the page source.
2) Go to *Application Tab > Cookies* .
3) Change the isAdmin value from 0 to 1 (granting admin previligies to the user)
4) Refresh the website and obtain the flag.
