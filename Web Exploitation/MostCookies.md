*This problem uses Flask cookies for encryption.*

Flask session cookies are considered more secure than standard encryption protocols.
Flask uses cookies to maintain session data between requests and stores data right inside the cookies.
These cookies contain a secret key to prevent modification from user.

 ### Method:
 1) Open the website, which will prompt you to enter a cookie. An example is given in form of 'snickerdoodle' which when entered, prompts entered information is right.
 2)  Go to *Inspect > Application > Cookies*.
 3)  A cookie is present which is a Flask cookie containing parts such as Base64Encoded URL, and MAC address.
 4)  After decoding the base64 decoded part, you can notice that very_auth is assigned to blank.
 5)  Upon viewing the .py file, we can notice that if very_auth is set to *blank*, the page wont display the flag. For this, we need to set it to *admin*.

 #### Flask Unsign is a tool which can decoded base 64 part of a flask cookie, can accept a parameter of a list of words to brute force for the signed key, and accept the key to show a functional Flask cookie.

 6) Open terminal and run flask unsign --unsign --cookie <cookie_name> which tells the content present in the cookie.
 7) Create a text file containing the terms in the *cookie_list* array in the python file.
 8) Pass it as a parameter to flas-unsign which allows the tool to brute force for the secret key. Obtain the secret key .
 9) Sign back the cookie while passing the secret cookie and change the very_auth segment to 'admin' (flask-unsign -sign -cookie '{"very_auth":"admin"}' -secret key
 10) Obtain the flag.
