In this question, we have to connect to a PostgreSQL server. For that first we need to navigate to the folder where Postgre is locally installed in our systems.

### Steps:
1) Open Terminal
2) Navigate to the folder when postgre has been installed. (Eg: C:/users/Ashrit/PostgreSQL)

Now, Copy paste the command into the terminal as mentioned in the question, this will take you to the server and prompt to enter password. 
After that, we can use the 

1) *\l* command to list out all the databases.
2) *\c* command can be used to select a particular database. (Eg:- \c pico would select the pico database.)
3) *\dt* would list out all the tables/relations present inside the database.
4) To print out the contents, we can use the command *select * from table_name;* to print them all out on the terminal.
